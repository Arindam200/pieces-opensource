## üì¶ SDKs

### üì¶ [Pieces OS Client SDK for Typescript](https://github.com/pieces-app/pieces-os-client-sdk-for-typescript) 
![NPM Logo](https://github.com/pieces-app/opensource/assets/55861512/40b41998-84a8-4f75-b4b5-c933c813e8fa)

Build on top of Pieces OS with this SDK and create your own Contextual Copilot. We reccomend downloading the package via NPM where you can find directions on how to use the API's inside of this package. This package for Typescript is easy to add to your project and gives you immediate access to all features in Pieces OS. You can always demo all of the available features by downloading [Pieces for Developers Desktop App and Pieces OS](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing).

## üç¶ Self Serve Examples

These examples are very focused, and show a specific feature/set of endpoints off. These are great for starting a project around, and can be useful for finding less cluttered examples that have fewer pending changes.

### üç¶ [Copilot Vanilla Example](https://github.com/pieces-app/pieces-copilot-vanilla-typescript-example)

See how you can use the Copilot by itself using a few endpoints and a WebSocket. Follow this here to see how you can stream in the conversation with your copilot.
