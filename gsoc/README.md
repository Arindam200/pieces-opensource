Together, we aim to achieve a future where technology serves as a force for positive change and where users and developers alike can build whatever tool fits their needs.

## Our Goals

- Educate developers on using copilots responsibly and to their advantage, while also allowing for learning and growth in their skill set
- Allow developers in locations with limited or poor connections work from home with access to a fast and functional copilot
- Make documentation globally available for all developers regardless of language or race
- Provide the tools needed to switch between different LLMs for any specific tasks
